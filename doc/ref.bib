abstract = {It is well known that the convex hull of a set of n points in the plane can be found by an algorithm having worst-case complexity O(n log n). A short linear-time algorithm for finding the convex hull when the points form the (ordered) vertices of a simple (i.e., non-self-intersecting) polygon is given.}
