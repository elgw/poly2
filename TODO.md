# To do or Maybe ...
 - More tests
 - Switch to CCW as the standard orientation?
 - Reduce the number of malloc/free calls.
 - Polygon rasterization using the even-odd rule or nonzero winding number, see Rourke Section 7.4
 - Minimal bounding box (oriented according to the principal directions).
 - Smarter plotting with axis abstraction? Or just drop that part?
