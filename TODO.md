# TODO
 - Orientation is likely to be wrong, due verification via plotting?
 - Reduce the number of malloc/free.
 - Polygon rasterization using the even-odd rule or nonzero winding number, see Rourke Section 7.4
 - Principal directions.
 - Minimal bounding box (oriented according to the principal directions).
 - Smarter plotting with axis abstraction?
